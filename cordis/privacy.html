        <h2>Cordis Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how Cordis collects, uses, and protects your personal information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>No Account Required:</strong> Cordis does not require you to create an account. You do not need to provide an email address, password, or any personal identification to use the app.</p>
        <p><strong>Profile Information:</strong> You may optionally provide your name and age group within the app. This information is stored locally on your device and is used solely to personalize your experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Health Data:</strong> If you grant permission, Cordis reads heart rate data from Apple Health (HealthKit). This data is used only within the app to display your heart rate history and statistics. Cordis does not write to or modify your HealthKit data beyond saving BPM entries you explicitly choose to save.</p>
        <p><strong>App Data:</strong> Your BPM entries, chat history with the Health Assistant, and app settings are stored locally on your device using SwiftData.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use your information exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Display your heart rate entries and wellness level classifications</li>
          <li>Generate personalized statistics and charts</li>
          <li>Provide context-aware responses in the Health Assistant</li>
          <li>Remember your preferences (name, age group, theme, reminders)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Health Information Disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Cordis is not a medical device.</strong> The app is designed solely for general wellness and educational purposes. It does not provide medical advice, medical diagnoses, or treatment recommendations of any kind.</p>
        <p>The heart rate data, wellness level classifications (such as "relaxed," "normal," "elevated," or "high"), and any information displayed within the app — including responses from the Health Assistant — are <strong>not</strong> intended to be used as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. These classifications are general wellness indicators based on publicly available age-group ranges and should not be interpreted as clinical assessments.</p>
        <p>The Health Assistant feature provides pre-written educational responses to frequently asked questions about general wellness topics. It does <strong>not</strong> use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or any algorithmic analysis to generate personalized medical recommendations. All responses are static, informational, and general in nature.</p>
        <p>Cordis does <strong>not</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition</li>
          <li>Provide clinical or medical-grade heart rate monitoring</li>
          <li>Replace the advice of a qualified healthcare professional</li>
          <li>Make any claims about detecting, predicting, or managing medical conditions</li>
          <li>Use algorithms to assess individual health risk or provide personalized medical guidance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The breathing exercises and guided meditation content offered in Cordis are intended for general relaxation and wellness purposes only. They are not therapeutic interventions and are not intended to treat anxiety, stress disorders, or any other medical or psychological condition.</p>
        <p><strong>Always consult a qualified healthcare provider</strong> with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information presented in this app. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All your personal data is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. Cordis does not transmit your health data, BPM entries, or personal information to any external server.</p>
        <p>Guided meditation audio files are delivered via Apple's CloudKit (iCloud) infrastructure. Only the audio content is stored in CloudKit — no personal data is uploaded.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Cordis does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or AI processing services. There is no external data processing of your personal information.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, share, or transmit your personal information to any third party. Your data stays on your device.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete all your BPM entries and chat history from within the app's Settings</li>
          <li>Revoke HealthKit permissions at any time through iOS Settings</li>
          <li>Delete the app to remove all locally stored data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Age Requirement</h2>
        <p>Cordis is intended for users aged 13 and older. The app is not directed at children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use this app. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected information from a user under 13, we will take steps to delete that information promptly.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the app.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:christian.arzaluz@gmail.com">christian.arzaluz@gmail.com</a>.</p>
